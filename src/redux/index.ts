/**
 * ReturnType<typeof store.getState> tells TypeScript to take the return type of 
 * store.getState (which is the current state) and set that as the type for RootState.
 * 
 * typeof store.dispatch
 * This infers the type of dispatch directly from the Redux store configuration, which means it 
 * will automatically know about all the actions your slices can dispatch, including 
 * asynchronous actions like Thunks if theyâ€™re added to the store.
